## Chart.js:
    - The first step to implementing chart.js on your webpage is downloading it.
    - You can draw different types of charts using canvas.
    - We utilized this in our pokecatcher lab when rendering our pokemon caught/seen results in a chart.
## Basic Canvas Usage:
    - The difference between <canvas> and <img> is that <canvas> doesn't have the src and alt attribute. 
    - The <canvas> element also requires a closing tag.
    - Fallback content is displayed when a browser that does not support <canvas> is used. 
## Drawing Shapes with Canvas:
    - Drawing on canvas is fun!
    - Canvas is based within an x y grid
    - you can draw different shapes and even more complex ones using pathing.
## Styles and Colors on Canvas:
    - fillStyle and strokeStyle are the two most important properties when coloring canvas shapes.
    - You can also draw translucent shapes by sing the transparencyValue
    - You can play arround with different lineWidth values to control the current line thickness.
    - You can go on to create gradients, and manipulate alpha to add more styles and colors.
## Drawing Text on Canvas:
    - You can use fillText and strokeText to render text in canvas.
    - You can style text with different properties such as font, textAlign and many more.
