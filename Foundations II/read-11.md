## Styling HTML5 Forms

    - This what a pretty cool series demonstrating how you can use CSS to customise user input forms. 
    - The uploader showed us how to style radio buttons, checkboxes, text inputs and more.
     - As someone that is all about ~styling~ I found it super helpful. I will for sure be adopting these practices for future projects!
