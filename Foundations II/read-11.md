## Styling HTML5 Forms

    - This what a pretty cool series demonstrating how you can use CSS to customise user input forms. From styling radio buttons, checkboxes an inputs. It was super easy to follow. As someone that is all about ~styling~ I found it super helpful. I will for sure be adopting these practices for future projects!
