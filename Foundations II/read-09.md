## SQL Relations and Joins
    - INNER JOIN is a process that matches rows from one table and another table which have the same key to create a result row with combined tables. 
    - LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN or FULL JOIN is used when two tables have asymmetric data to ensure that the data we need is not left out of our results.
    - It's not always possible to avoid NULL values but it's best to reduce the posibility of them.

## Database Normalization
    - A proccess used to organize a database into tables and columns.
    - By limiting data to one purpose you can reduce duplicates and simplify queries.
    - There are 3 steps to normalization
        1) No repeating groups of columns.
        2) All columns have primary ID
        3) Columns should not depend on each other
