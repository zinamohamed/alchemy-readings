## SQL
    - SQL or Structured Query Language, is a language used for databases to provide safe and scalable storage for websites and mobile applications.
    - To retrieve data from a SQL database you need to write SELECT statements reffered to as queries. It declares what data we are looking for and returns it.
    - We can use a WHERE clause to filter certain results.
    - We can use the DISTINCT keyword to remove duplicates and discard rows.
    - The database SCHEMA is what describes the structure of each table.
    - When inserting new data into a database, we can use the INSERT statement.
    - When updating existing data we can use the UPDATE statement.
