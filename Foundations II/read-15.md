    - In the early 80's people began noticing that the percentage of women in other STEM related fields were rising, whereas women in CS flattened.
    - This is largerly attributed to the ongoing narrative that most tech related things are associated with men and boys.

    - Overall, everyone deserves a seat at the table, and it's important that companies allow people from historically marginalized communities a chance
